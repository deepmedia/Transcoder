/**
 * Holds state associated with a Surface used for MediaCodec decoder output.
 * <p>
 * The (width,height) constructor for this class will prepare GL, create a SurfaceTexture,
 * and then create a Surface for that SurfaceTexture.  The Surface can be passed to
 * MediaCodec.configure() to receive decoder output.  When a frame arrives, we latch the
 * texture with updateTexImage, then render the texture with GL to a pbuffer.
 * REMOVED THIS
 * <p>
 * The no-arg constructor skips the GL preparation step and doesn't allocate a pbuffer.
 * Instead, it just creates the Surface and SurfaceTexture, and when a frame arrives
 * we just draw it on whatever surface is current.
 * <p>
 * By default, the Surface will be using a BufferQueue in asynchronous mode, so we
 * can potentially drop frames.
