# Intro

The Transcoder library transcodes and compresses video files into the MP4 format, with audio support, using hardware-accelerated
Android codecs available on the device. Works on API 19+ and supports the following set of features:

- Fast transcoding to AAC/AVC
- Hardware accelerated
- Convenient, fluent API
- Thumbnails support
- [Concatenate](concatenation) multiple video and audio tracks
- [Clip or trim](clipping) video segments
- Configure [output size](track-strategies#video-size), with automatic cropping
- Configure [output rotation](advanced-options#video-rotation)
- Configure [output speed](advanced-options#video-speed)
- Configure [output frame rate](track-strategies#other-options)
- Configure [output audio channels](track-strategies#audio-strategies) and sample rate
- [Override timestamp](advanced-options#time-interpolation) of frames, for example to slow down parts of the video
- [Error handling](events)
- Configurable [validators](validators) to e.g. avoid transcoding if the source is already compressed enough
- Configurable video and audio [strategies](track-strategies)

> This project started as a fork of [ypresto/android-transcoder](https://github.com/ypresto/android-transcoder).
With respect to the source project, which misses most of the functionality listed above,
we have also fixed a huge number of bugs and are much less conservative when choosing options
that might not be supported. The source project will always throw - for example, accepting only 16:9,
AVC Baseline Profile videos - we prefer to try and let the codec fail if it wants to.

## Minimal example

```kotlin
Transcoder.into(filePath)
    .addDataSource(context, uri) // or...
    .addDataSource(filePath) // or...
    .addDataSource(fileDescriptor) // or...
    .addDataSource(dataSource)
    .setListener(object : TranscoderListener {
         override fun onTranscodeProgress(progress: Double) = Unit
         override fun onTranscodeCompleted(successCode: Int) = Unit
         override fun onTranscodeCanceled() = Unit
         override fun onTranscodeFailed(exception: Throwable) = Unit
    }).transcode()
```
