Transcoder is maintained and, for the most part, developed by Mattia Iavarone ([contact me!](contact)). If you like the project, 
use it with profit, or simply want to thank back, please consider 
[sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/natario1) through the GitHub Sponsors program!

I offer private support hours through the sponsorship program and I'm open to help your 
company with features that are not currently supported by the open source project.

Thank you for any contribution!
